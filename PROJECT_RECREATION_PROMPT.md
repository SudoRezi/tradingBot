## DEBUGGING & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
1. **Port 5000 in use**: Change port in Streamlit config
2. **API rate limits**: Implement proper rate limiting
3. **Database locks**: Use connection pooling
4. **Memory issues**: Optimize data structures

### Performance Optimization
```python
# Implement caching for expensive operations
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def expensive_calculation(data):
    # Cached expensive operations
    pass
```

### Monitoring & Logging
```python
import logging

# Implement comprehensive logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('trading_bot.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Performance KPIs
- **Trading Accuracy**: Target 85-95% success rate
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Target > 2.0
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Keep < 10%
- **System Uptime**: Target 99.9%

### Technical Metrics
- **API Response Time**: < 100ms average
- **Order Execution Speed**: < 1 second
- **Data Processing Latency**: < 50ms
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### API Security
- Encrypt API keys at rest
- Use environment variables, never hardcode
- Implement API key rotation
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Database Security
- SQLite encryption for sensitive data
- Regular backups with encryption
- Access control and audit logging

### Network Security
- HTTPS only for all communications
- VPN support for remote access
- Firewall configuration

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Tests
```python
import unittest

class TestTradingLogic(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_buy_signal_generation(self):
        # Test trading signal logic
        pass
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# Test API integrations
def test_exchange_connectivity():
    # Test exchange API connections
    pass
```

### Performance Tests
```python
# Test system performance under load
def test_high_frequency_trading():
    # Stress test the system
    pass
```
